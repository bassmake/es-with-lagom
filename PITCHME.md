# Event Sourcing with Lagom

---
### Event sourcing
- Every change is stored as an event
- Command is applied and Events are published
- Easy to create new read models (projections)
- Data for audit out of the box
- Easier to reason about in complex systems
- Higher complexity compared to CRUD in init phases
